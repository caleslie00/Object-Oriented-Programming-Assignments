	Programming 2, and Object Oriented Programming by picking up items and talking to NPCs to increase your various programming skills.

Choice? D

-- You start off by entering a name and choosing a major. The major chosen will determine what your starting stats are and how many moves
	you have each turn.

You have 6 moves until the Athene Final!

--Enter command: key

Key: U = You, the player
     H = Dr. Homer
     N = Nathan
     C = Caleb
     ! = Mystery Item
     * = Empty space (Or is it? ... )

--Enter command:

-- As you can see, unlike several text adventure games, Clap Gang Adventure creates a rendering of the map you are currently in with keys
	to designate where everything is so that there is no confusion (however, do not trust the map to show you everything, there may be
	some hidden items, commands, or interactions untold to the player). Continuing:

--Enter command: help
Here is a list of commands:
        move [left, right, up, down]
        train [tracing, writing, data, abstraction]
        talk
        pickup
        key
        stats
        test
        help (duh, you just used it)
        quit

-- Additionally, a help menu is available as a simple command. In addition, all commands are case-insensitive, so you don't have to worry
	too much about the specificity of the commands, just get the words right. Continuing:

You have 4 moves until the Athene Final!
**UN

--Enter command: move right

You have 3 moves until the Athene Final!
***U

--Enter command: talk

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Nathan: *looks at code* What are you even doing here... lets think about this...|
|Tracing Skill + 2!                                                              |
|Writing Skill + 2!                                                              |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--Enter command:

-- Moving on top of an NPC and using the talk command allows you to interact with this NPC. This action will often also increase your
	programming skills to help you pass the test when you run out of moves. Continuing:

You have 1 moves until the Athene Final!
***N
*!U*
****
C!*H

--Enter command: move left

You have 0 moves until the Athene Final!
You can still use any commands such as "pickup" or "talk", but you cannot move (or train)! It is time for the test! Type "test" to take the test.

--Enter command: pickup

-----------------------------
|You picked up a razorMouse!|
|Tracing Skill +5!          |
-----------------------------


--Enter command:

-- Additionally, using "pickup" while over an item picks up the item and removes it from the board will also add to the player's inventory
	and usually improve skills. Using the pickup or talk commands also does not break the game if used improperly. They also do not
	reduce the number of moves you have. So here, we were out of moves, but could still pick up the item we were on top of. Continuing:

--Enter command: test

----------------------------------
|Code Tracing Ability? Excellent!|
|Code Writing Ability? Excellent!|
----------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Phew, you passed! That Athene Test was something else wasn't it?               |
|But, you ain't finished yet! You still got at least 2 more years of this stuff!|
|On to P2!                                                                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Great job passing an entry level class :)                                                                                                              |
|Now its time to learn a little bit more about behind the scences and everything that Dr.Homer said we would talk about later is now being talked about!|
|Although it's exciting its more challenging.                                                                                                           |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|You walk into the Programming II classroom to find, to your surprize, two professors: Dr. Homer and Dr. Reeves.                           |
|You also notice Nathan is back as your tutor again. He sure is helpful for leaning many things.                                           |
|You also heard this strange sound come from right above you... Might be nothing, but you have no time to waste! The P2 final will be soon!|

-- Typing "test" will put you against the Athene final for that course. If you pass, you move on to the next level (from P1 to P2 to OOP)
	If you fail, you will have to repeat that level with no duplicate items, but you can still talk to NPCs and train.

--Enter command: train tracing

|You went back through some old code, and found the errors pretty quick, resulting in a small improvement.|
|Tracing Skill +1                                                                                         |

--Enter command:

-- As such, you also have the ability to "train" a specific skill you may be slightly lacking in. This takes up a move point, but can also
	be used as a way to increase stats when you would not be able to reach anything with move points anyway.

--Enter command: quit


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Thank you for playing the Clap Gang Adventure!! We hope you've enjoyed. Never stop clapping.|
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The command "quit" can also be given at any time to end the program early.

-- Obviously there are more amazing things about this game, but that covers the basis are uniqueness of it. 
	Have fun finding the few hidden fun things in the game, and good luck!
